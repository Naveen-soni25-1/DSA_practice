# 📚 DSA Practice

This repository contains my personal Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice.  
All problems are implemented in Python and structured for easy reference and revision.

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

I created this to:
- Practice and improve my DSA understanding.
- Build strong problem-solving skills for coding interviews.
- Keep track of the concepts I've learned and practiced.

## 💡 Tip

If you're learning DSA, try reading the code and running it with your own test cases.  
You’ll understand how each algorithm works much better that way!
